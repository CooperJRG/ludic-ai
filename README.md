Ludic-AI: A Multi-Game AI Playground (Work in Progress) Ô∏è
Ludic-AI is a Python project aiming to develop a single AI capable of playing a variety of classic games, including:

Tic-Tac-Toe
Go
Chess
Battleship
Connect Four
Monopoly
This project is currently in its early stages of development, but the goal is to create an AI that can play each game at a high level using various techniques such as:

Minimax: A powerful search algorithm for two-player games with perfect information.
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): A more versatile algorithm for games with large state spaces and incomplete information.
Deep Learning: Leveraging neural networks to identify complex patterns and strategies within games.
Reinforcement Learning: Training the AI through trial and error, allowing it to learn optimal strategies from self-play.
Ludic-AI is designed to be:

Modular: Each game is implemented as a separate module, allowing for easy expansion and customization.
Open-source: The code is freely available on GitHub for anyone to contribute to and learn from.
Educational: The project provides an excellent opportunity to explore various AI concepts and techniques in a practical and engaging setting.
Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!

Please note: This project is still under active development and several features are not yet implemented. Feel free to contribute and help make Ludic-AI the ultimate multi-game AI champion!
